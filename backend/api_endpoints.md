    Benford's Law: Analyzes the frequency distribution of leading digits in vote counts.
    Digit Analysis: Examines the distribution of digits in vote counts for irregular patterns.
    Machine Learning: Utilizes algorithms to identify outliers and anomalies in election data.

Regression Analysis
    Example: A study found that the prevalence of absentee voting in 2020 had a moderately strong and statistically significant impact on turnout.

Gerrymandering
    Declination: Measures the difference between the proportion of votes and the proportion of seats won.
    Efficiency Gap: Quantifies wasted votes to assess the fairness of district boundaries.
